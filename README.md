## Getting Started

First, install the packages and run the development server:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install

```

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## Notes
The project is using a local data, but am using react-query to show how the data could be fetched from an api endpoint.

## Deploy on Vercel
